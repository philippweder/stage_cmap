At this point, I would like to thank my supervisors Fran√ßois Alouges and Aline Lefebvre-Lepot for their numerous comments, suggestions and corrections during my internship and for making this internship possible in the first place in spite of the difficult situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I would also like to offer a word of thanks to my co-intern Ward Haegeman for his keen eye for mistakes in my calculations and to Giovanni di Fratta for his help with the 3D rendering of the figures.
