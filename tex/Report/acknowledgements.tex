I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Dr. François Alouges and Dr. Aline Lefebvre-Lepot for their numerous comments, suggestions and corrections during my internship at Ecole Polytechnique and my last semester at ETH Zürich, and for making this project possible in the first place in spite of the difficult situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Habib Ammari for endorsing this project as co-supervisor at ETH Zürich. Finally, I would like to offer a word of thanks to my co-intern at Ecole Polytechnique, Ward Haegeman, for his keen eye for mistakes in my calculations and to Giovanni di Fratta for his help with the 3D rendering of the figures.
