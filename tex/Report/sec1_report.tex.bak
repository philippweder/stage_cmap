We restrict ourselves to considering the swimmer \spr proposed in \citep{Alouges2013}. Let $(S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4)$ be a regular reference tetrahedron centered at $c \in \R^3$ such that $||S_i - c|| = 1$ for all $i \in \N_4$. Then the swimmer consists of four balls $(B_i)_{i \in \N_4}$ of $\R^3$ centered at $b_i \in \R^3$, all of radius $a > 0$. Then the ball $B_i$ can move along the ray starting at $c$ and passing through $S_i$. This reflects the situation where the balls are linked together by think jacks that are able to elongate. However, the viscous resistance of these jacks is neglected and therefore the fluid is assumed to fill
